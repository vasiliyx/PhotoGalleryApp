# PhotoGalleryApp


## Sprint I (Due Jan 27st) 

•	As a team, establish naming conventions for resources as well as java code. 

•	Create a Git repository for the project that everyone in the team will use i.e. pull/push/merge. Come up with a branching structure of the Git. 

• 	Incorporate Continuous Integration and Testing (i.e. automatic running of UI and Unit tests) by integrating Jenkins to Git.
You should also consider deploying the Android app to Google Play and the server side to AWS. 
Also study Agile Project Management environments such as Jira and Visual Studio Online, although use of these tools for the project management purposes is not required 




**Produce 1st release of the software system. This release is mainly an Android app that:**

•	allows user to take photos and stores these on a file system folder, 

•	automatically tags each captured photo with the current timestamp, 

•	[ 1 mark] allows user to add and/or edit a caption to the photo, and 

•	[1 marks] supports time as well as caption based search of the photos and ability to view these photos. 


The GUI should be based on what we decide in the class. Additionally, automated UI Tests for the add/edit caption as well as time/location based search functionality of the app should be developed using Espresso (preferrably before the development of these features starts as per BDD) [2 marks].
